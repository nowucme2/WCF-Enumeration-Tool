# WCF Enumeration Tool

A Python-based tool to automate the enumeration of WCF service endpoints. Supports both HTTP/HTTPS, automatic screenshot capturing, 403 bypass attempts, and interactive file path selection with TAB completion.

## ðŸ”§ Features
- Enumerates common WCF endpoints
- Auto HTTP/HTTPS fallback
- Headers to bypass basic 403 protections
- Saves all results clearly (200, 403, 404)
- Screenshots for every result
- TAB completion for input file path
- Clean output structure in `results/`
